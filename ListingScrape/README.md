This is a simple test project using node & puppeteer that extracts some fields from the listing page.
This case has a load more button and we need to go to the last visible button to appear all results.
All processes finished in around 1:40 minutes and this time is mostly used to load the headless browser, click button action and writing values to the csv file.
